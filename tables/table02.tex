\midrule				
\textbf{Capital Requirements}	&			\\
Capital	&	Capital requirements for banks, which include risk weights, systemic risk buffers, and minimum capital requirements.	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Capital Conservation Buffer (CCoB)	&	Additional capital requirementsto to conserve a bank’s capital.	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)	&	Additional capital requirements for an elevated risk of above-normal future losses.  Capital should be accumulated when cyclical systemic risk is judged to be increasing.		\\
\textbf{Loan Restrictions}	&			\\
Limit on Leverage of Bank (LVR)	&	Limits on leverage of banks, calculated by dividing a measure of capital by the bank’s non-risk-weighted exposures.	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Loan Loss Provision(LLP)	&	Loan loss provision requirements for macroprudential purposes, which include dynamic provisioning and sectoral provisions (e.g. housing loans).	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Limits on Growth of Credit (LCG)	&	Limits on growth or the volume of aggregate credit, the household-sector credit, or the corporate-sector credit by banks, and penalties for high credit growth. 	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Loan Restrictions (LoanR)	&	Loan restrictions, that are more tailored than those captured in "LCG". They include loan limits and prohibitions, which may be conditioned on loan characteristics.	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Limits to Loan-to-Value ratios (LTV)	&	Limits to the loan-to-value ratios, including those mostly targeted at housing loans, but also includes those targeted at automobile loans, and commercial real estate loans.	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Limits to Debt-Service-to-Income Ratio (DSTI)	&	Limits to the debt-service-to-income ratio and the loan-to-income ratio, which restrict the size of debt services or debt relative to income. They include those targeted at housing loans, consumer loans, and commercial real estate loans.	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LTD)	&	Limits to the loan-to-deposit ratio and penalties for high LTD ratios.		\\
\textbf{Others}	&			\\
Liquidity	&	Measures taken to mitigate systemic liquidity and funding risks, including minimum requirements for liquidity coverage ratios, liquid asset ratios, net stable funding ratios, core funding ratios and external debt restrictions that do not distinguish currencies.	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Limits on Foreign Currency (LFC)	&	Limits on foreign currency (FC) lending, and rules or recommendations on FC loans.	\vspace{0.5em}	\\
Limits on Foreign Exchange (LFX)	&	Limits on net or gross open foreign exchange (FX) positions, limits on FX exposures and FX funding, and currency mismatch regulations.		\\
